\release{2016-07-25}{1.6.0}{0.4.0}{
  \note{feature}{
    We now provide an official \reference{docker-repository}{Docker
    repository} at \code{concourse/concourse}!

    As part of this, the \reference{binaries}{binary distribution} has been
    updated to support environment variables for configuration, in addition to
    flags. Because \hyperlink{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM}{the
    environment is perfectly safe}.

    Thanks to \ghuser{gregarcara} and \ghuser{MeteoGroup} for maintaining
    Concourse images until we started on this ourselves!

  \note{feature}{
    The \resource{bosh-io-release}{bosh.io Release} will now verify SHA1 checksums, and place
    them in the fetched directory as \code{sha1}. The
    \resource{bosh-io-stemcell}{bosh.io Stemcell} has also been updated so that they both have
    the same behavior.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    The \resource{docker-image} now supports ECR! There were a couple issues
    and pull requests opened for this; thanks to all who kept the ball rolling!
